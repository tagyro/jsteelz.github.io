    <div class="text">
      Currently, the majority of ridership on the corridor originates from stops currently served by the 323 or the 523.
      Potential for a successful limited-stop service on this corridor is large. Better pedestrian access to Valley Fair
      and O'Connor Hospital would help bridge the lost connection at Valley Fair Transit Center.<br><br>

      Note that Stelling and Stevens Creek counts De Anza College Transit Center as part of the stops for that intersection.
      It is still some distance from the intersection, however. Many users might stick to the 23 for trips originating from
      this intersection out of convenience.

    <div class="text">
      This is the only section where ridership at local-only stops is higher than that at others. One reason for this
      is that the 523 will not serve the Fair Oaks / Old San Francisco corridor. Another is that the stop nearest to De Anza
      College was counted as a local-only stop, as it is far from Stevens Creek Boulevard. If that were to be reversed, the
      ridership tally would be about the same.<br><br>

      Of note is the fact that the 54, serving Hollenbeck Road, currently generates a significant amount of ridership as well
      when compared to the 55. Route 54 is deleted, however, in the current plan. Hollenbeck and Sunnyvale-Saratoga are a 10-minute
      walk apart, but the very unwalkable street patterns make that time much longer if the trip does not originate from a through
      road between the two. The 7.5-10 minute decrease in average wait time will likely not offset a 10+ minute increase in walking
      time and its associated inconvenience. There is a large potential for net ridership loss in the De Anza - Sunnyvale corridor.

    <div class="text">
      As is visible above, this section has very low ridership compared to the other two. Lockheed Martin Transit Center
      provides the vast majority of boardings in this section at 61 boardings per weekday.

    <div class="header">Takeaways</div>
    <div class="subheader">Note: still fear of incomplete data</div>
    <div class="text">
      On two out of three sections of the proposed 523, ridership at stops served by future and current limited service
      have higher total ridership than stops not served by limited service. This difference is most pronounced on the section served
      by current route 23. On the section that bucks this trend (De Anza College to Sunnyvale), the choice of stops for the future
      523 will have a large impact on ridership - and the stops included above are not the plan's official stops.<br><br>

      Current ridership on the Lockheed Martin-Sunnyvale corridor is very low for both limited and non-limited stops.
      The low-density housing and land use of the area, as well as the many expressways and pedestrian-unfriendly
      layout the area, are perhaps partly to blame.<br><br>

      While the current 323 ridership is underwhelming, the data above shows that the 523 has potential to improve on it.
      However, because the origins and destinations of trips are separated, it is not possible to know how many trips
      originating at 323 stops end at non-323 stops, and vice versa. Because of the high perceived transfer friction of bus
      transit, it is unlikely that riders would use the 523, then transfer to the 23 to cover the last mile. An origin-destination
      survey would help in this regard.<br><br>

      Lastly, two of the highest-ridership sections of the Sunnyvale - De Anza corridor will have no all-day service in the final
      plan. There is no service on Hollenbeck Road in the final plan, and there is school-only service on the Old San Francisco /
      Fair Oaks section of current route 55. For this reason, a net ridership loss in this corridor, even over a longer term,
      is not out of the question.
